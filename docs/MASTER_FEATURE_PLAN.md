# Master Feature Development Plan
## Green School Management System

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Planning Phase

## Executive Summary

This document provides the master plan for developing all 15 features of the Green School Management System. Each feature follows a standardized development workflow ensuring consistency, quality, and GDPR compliance.

## Development Principles

### 1. Sequential Feature Development
- Build ONE feature at a time completely before moving to next
- Complete all phases (Database → API → UX → Testing → Documentation) per feature
- No parallel feature development to maintain focus and quality

### 2. Full CRUD Implementation
Every feature must implement complete CRUD operations:
- **Create**: Add new records
- **Read**: View single record details
- **List**: View all records with pagination and filtering
- **Update**: Modify existing records
- **Delete**: Remove records (soft delete preferred for audit trail)

### 3. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- All tables include `school_id` for tenant separation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data boundaries
- Test cross-tenant access prevention for each feature

### 4. GDPR/POPPI Compliance
- Audit logging for all CRUD operations
- Parental consent checks where applicable
- Data retention policy enforcement
- Right to deletion support

## Feature Development Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Features 1-2)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Required for all other features

1. **Users** - Core authentication and authorization
