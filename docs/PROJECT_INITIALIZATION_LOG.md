## Technology Stack Confirmed

### Frontend
- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Vite (build tool)
- Pinia (state management)
- Vue Router 3 (routing)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Headless UI (accessible components)
- Heroicons (icon library)
- Playwright (E2E testing)

### Backend
- Python API (likely FastAPI or similar)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (database)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- express-validator (validation)
- pytest (testing)

### Authentication
- Keycloak (SSO/OAuth)
- Realm: Green-School-id
- Client ID: Green-School-id

### Infrastructure
- Docker & Docker Compose
- 4 containers: Frontend (3000), Backend (8000), Database (5432), Keycloak (8080)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Multi-Tenant via Row Level Security
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL RLS for data isolation instead of application-level filtering
**Rationale**: Database-level enforcement is more secure, impossible to bypass
**Implementation**: school_id + RLS policies on all tables

### 2. Soft Delete Everywhere
**Decision**: Never hard delete, always set deleted_at timestamp
**Rationale**: GDPR audit trail requirements, data recovery, compliance
**Implementation**: deleted_at and deleted_by fields on all tables

### 3. UUID Primary Keys
**Decision**: Use UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers
**Rationale**: Distributed system compatibility, security (no sequential IDs)
**Implementation**: gen_random_uuid() default on all id columns

### 4. Sequential Feature Development
**Decision**: Build one complete feature at a time, not multiple in parallel
**Rationale**: Reduces context switching, ensures quality, builds confidence
**Implementation**: Master plan with strict ordering, quality gates

### 5. 15-Phase Workflow Per Feature
**Decision**: Standardize on 15-phase development workflow for every feature
**Rationale**: Ensures consistency, prevents missed steps, provides time estimates
**Implementation**: Detailed checklist template with checkboxes

### 6. API-First Design
**Decision**: Document all API endpoints before writing any code
**Rationale**: Frontend and backend can develop in parallel, clear contract
**Implementation**: API_ROUTES_MASTER.md with all 129+ endpoints

### 7. Design System First
**Decision**: Complete design system before building any UX
**Rationale**: Ensures consistency, speeds up development, improves quality
**Implementation**: UX_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md with all components specified

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)
1. **Review all documentation**
   - Team walkthrough of CLAUDE.md
   - Review master feature plan
   - Confirm development workflow

2. **Initialize Git repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Project planning and documentation"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Set up Docker environment**
   - Create docker-compose.yml
   - Configure Keycloak container
   - Configure PostgreSQL container
   - Configure backend API container
   - Configure frontend container
   - Test containers start successfully

4. **Create project scaffolding**
   - Initialize frontend Vue 3 project
   - Initialize backend Python project
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Configure TypeScript
   - Set up linting and formatting
   - Create base folder structure

5. **Database initialization**
   - Create greenschool database
   - Set up migration framework
   - Create first migration (schools table)
   - Test migration runs successfully

### Week 2: Feature 01 - Users
1. Copy DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md → users-checklist.md
2. Follow 15-phase workflow exactly:
   - Phase 1: Planning & Review
   - Phase 2: Database Design
   - Phase 3: ORM Models
   - (Continue through all 15 phases)
3. Pass all quality gates
4. Update progress in MASTER_FEATURE_PLAN.md
5. Mark Feature 01 as COMPLETE

### Week 3: Feature 02 - Schools
1. Copy checklist template
2. Follow 15-phase workflow
3. Ensure multi-tenancy working
4. Pass all quality gates
5. Mark Feature 02 as COMPLETE

### Weeks 4-20: Features 03-15
Continue sequentially through all remaining features using the same workflow.

## Success Criteria

This initialization is considered successful if:

- [x] CLAUDE.md provides clear guidance for AI assistants
- [x] README.md provides clear overview for developers
- [x] All 15 features have documented requirements
- [x] Complete database schema designed
- [x] Complete API surface area documented
- [x] Complete UX design system specified
- [x] Development workflow clearly defined
- [x] Quality gates established
- [x] Timeline estimated
- [x] Project ready for development to begin

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Risk**: Features expand beyond original specification
**Mitigation**: Strict adherence to feature plans, change control process, defer enhancements to v2

### Risk 2: Multi-Tenant Bugs
**Risk**: Data leakage between schools
**Mitigation**: RLS policies at database level, comprehensive testing, security audits

### Risk 3: Development Bottlenecks
**Risk**: Dependencies between features cause delays
**Mitigation**: Strict sequential development order, clear dependency mapping

### Risk 4: GDPR Non-Compliance
**Risk**: Missing audit trail or consent tracking
**Mitigation**: Checklist per feature for compliance, legal review, penetration testing

### Risk 5: Timeline Overruns
**Risk**: Features take longer than estimated
**Mitigation**: Conservative estimates (25-40 hours), buffer time, prioritize Phase 1-3

## Lessons Learned (Proactive)

### For Future Claude Code Sessions
1. **Start with CLAUDE.md** - Provides immediate context
2. **Reference feature plans** - Don't reinvent, follow the plan
3. **Use development checklist** - Check off each task
4. **Update progress tracking** - Keep master plan current
5. **Follow git commit patterns** - Consistent commit messages
6. **Test multi-tenancy always** - Never skip isolation tests
7. **Document as you go** - Don't defer documentation

### For Development Team
1. **One feature at a time** - Resist urge to parallelize
2. **Pass quality gates** - Don't skip steps
3. **Follow 15-phase workflow** - It's there for a reason
4. **Test in Docker** - Local dev can mask issues
5. **Review security** - Multi-tenant systems are high risk
6. **Communicate progress** - Update master plan regularly

## Conclusion
